The "Portfolio" project is a personal website created to showcase myself as an
individual, my programming skills, and the technologies I can utilize. This
platform is designed to share my professional information with visitors, express
my expertise, and demonstrate personal works and projects.

## Bio

The website includes information about me, my name, and contact details. A brief
biography and essential details about my education and work experience are
provided.

of programming languages, frameworks, and other tools that I am proficient in.
This helps visitors gain a better understanding of my capabilities and keeps
them updated on the latest technologies.

The "Projects" section showcases my major works and projects that I have been
involved in. Each project is accompanied by a short description, images, and the
ability to access project details.
